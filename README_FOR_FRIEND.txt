HOW TO RUN GSUITE CLI ON WINDOWS

1. Double-click "setup_python.bat".
2. If it asks to install Python, follow the instructions.
3. Once the black window stays open and says "Setup Complete!", type:
   gs welcome

That's it!

Troubleshooting:
- If `setup_python.bat` closes immediately, try right-clicking it and selecting "Run as Administrator".
- Make sure you extracted the ZIP file before running the script.
